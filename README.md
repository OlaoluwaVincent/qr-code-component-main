## About The Project

<p>This HTML & CSS only challenge is perfect for anyone just starting out or anyone wanting a small project to play around with.
The main challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
<br>2. See hover states for interactive elements</p>
<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

There was nothing new I did not know before. However, I learnt to implement the
SCSS compiler myself. I had issues calling variables because I used the Normal
CSS syntax instead of the SCSS syntax.

I am now getting flexible with Media Queries

This Challenge helped me to exercise what I've been learning. It definitely
helps to find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
